# Welcome to my resume!

I have built this resume website using Svelte and TailWindCSS after going through the following courses
- [FrontEnd Masters's Svelte Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sveltekit/) by Rich Harris himself!
- The amazing [Svelte tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte)
- FreeCodeCamp's [Svelte and Tailwind CSS course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2UjwQzxvBQ) by SmolJames, which deserves a special mention because I used this course for the website's structure
